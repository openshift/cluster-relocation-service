                        they are referenced by their digests. The mirrored location
                        is obtained by replacing the part of the input reference that
                        matches source by the mirrors entry, e.g. for registry.redhat.io/product/repo

                        lower priority than all mirrors. If no mirror is specified
                        or all image pulls from the mirror list fail, the image will
                        continue to be pulled from the repository in the pull spec
